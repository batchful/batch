# batchful
A simple and easy-to use batch directory organizer. 

No installation needed -- just run the `.bat` file in the desired folder.

## Usage
Paste the program in the directory you wish to organize and run it.

### Configuration
There are currently two implemented methods of organization *(more coming soon -- see below)*: 
1. By file extension: creates a directory for every filetype and sorts the files accordingly. 
2. By file name: creates a folder for every single file name and sorts the files into them.

You will also be presented with the option to sort through subfolders.
This process deletes the unnecessary folders after it's done sorting.

## Coming Soon
- The option to sort files by regex: finds a specific phrase anywhere in the file name 
- A GUI version of the program is in development
- Making the file extension option only create folders for used files
