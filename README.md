# batchful
A simple and easy-to use batch directory organizer. 

No installation needed -- just run the `.bat` file in the desired folder.

## Usage
Paste the program in the directory you wish to organize and run it.

### Configuration
There are currently two implemented methods of organization *(more coming soon -- see below)*: 
1. By file extension: creates a directory for every filetype and sorts the files accordingly. 
2. By file name: creates a folder for every single file name and sorts the files into them.

## Coming Soon
- The option to sort files by regex: finds a specific phrase anywhere in the file name
- A GUI version of the program is in early development, but is low on our list
- The ability to search sub-folders for items and rename files if names clash
- Making the file extension option only create folders for used files
